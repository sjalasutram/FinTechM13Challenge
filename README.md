# FinTechM13Challenge
Module 13 Challenge Work

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables.

* Preprocess data for a neural network model.
* Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
* Optimize the model.

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
* Optimize the neural network model.
